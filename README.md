# Audio Player with Controls & Waveform

This project is a custom Audio Player built using React and WaveSurfer.js for rendering audio waveforms. It allows users to load, play, pause, and control the volume of an audio file. Key features include a waveform visualization, a play/pause button, volume control (with mute/unmute functionality), and real-time display of the current audio time and duration. The player also provides volume adjustment via buttons and a slider, making it user-friendly. The FontAwesome icons are used for interactive controls like play, pause, volume, and mute.
